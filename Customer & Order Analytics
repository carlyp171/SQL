#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

--#1 How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT Count(orderID) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales;

--#2 How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT Count(orderID) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE product= 'iPhone';

--#3 Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT acctnum FROM BIT_DB.customers a
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales b
ON a.order_id = b.orderid

--#4 Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT distinct product, price FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
ORDER BY price ASC
LIMIT 1;

--#5 What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT product, SUM(quantity)*price as revenue 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;

--#6 Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT product, sum(quantity) as total_sold, SUM(quantity)*price as total_revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location ='548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'

--#7 How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT count(cust.acctnum) as customers, AVG(quantity*price) as avg_spent 
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
